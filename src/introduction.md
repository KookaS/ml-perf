# Introduction

This book's goal is to cover most of the skills required to work as a Performance Engineer in modern ML labs.

I started it for interview preparation, but it quickly evolved into a more comprehensive list of skills I acquired during my time at Google Deepmind. A lot of the skills required in ML performance are scattered around in different resources or have to be learnt on the job by talking to more experienced engineers. This book tries to assemble the most important bits in a single place.

I use Gemini extensively to refine my words (I am not a native english speaker) and to generate diagrams (with Nano Banana 3.)

## Prerequisites

A good understanding of computer programming is required. Linear algebra, Machine Learning, and distributed programming skills will greatly help understanding the material but are not necessary.
